# DoomBuggies-3D-Game
A silly game based purely on opengl API without using game engine. This was basically a challenge thrown at me where I would have to prove that games can be made without using game engines. I do agree that doing so was like re-inventing the "wheel" but I sure did learn a lot about making games. 

## Compilation Instructions ## 
This project was originally developed using MinGW but then I had ported it over to Microsoft Compiler. You can go ahead and clone the reposistory and build the project. its that simple. 

## Objective of the Game ##
You get 4 buggies that you control and the computers gets 4 buggies that you control. In order to win the game, you need to destroy all 4 enemies buggies. Your buggies and the enemies buggies look quite similar as they dont have military camouflage on however the enemies have an orange tint while your buggies have a green tint. 

The more time you take to destroy the enemies, the faster they will get so hurry before they kill you !!

## How to Play the Game ##
- Moving the camera requires you to use the keys mentioned below 
  - W = moves the camera forward
  - S = moves the camera backwards
  - A = moves the camera left 
  - R = moves the camera right 
- Looking around is done by moving the mouse while you have the mouse left button pressed. 
- You move your buggies by first left clicking on the buggy itself and then left clicking the desired position on the floor. 
- You shoot the enemies by first left clicking on your buggy and then left clicking on the enemy buggy. 
- Every now and then health package and weapon package will appear on the floor. you can left click on one of your buggies and then left click on the health or weapon package to acquire it.
